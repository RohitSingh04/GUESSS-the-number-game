The concept of surface area and volume for class 10 is provided here. In this article, we are going to discuss the surface area and volume for different solid shapes such as the cube, cuboid, cone, cylinder, and so on. The surface area can be generally classified into Lateral Surface Area (LSA), Total Surface Area (TSA), and Curved Surface Area (CSA). Here, let us discuss the surface area formulas and volume formulas for different three-dimensional shapes in detail.

so i dicided to make  progrm hich ill find csa tsa and volume of 3d shapes
